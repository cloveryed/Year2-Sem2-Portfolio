## About This Portfolio
This repository serves as a comprehensive showcase of my technical projects and assignments from Year 2 of my Cybersecurity diploma program. Each project demonstrates practical application of security concepts and tools learned throughout the semester.

## About Me
I am currently a scholarship student at Ngee Ann polytechnic graduated from Clementi Town Secondary School. I am studying Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics and have a passion for dance. Through practical labs and academic projects, I have developed strong technical skills in Linux environments, digital forensics tools, and security testing methodologies.
I am comfortable working with tools such as Wireshark, Kali Linux, Burp Suite, EnCase, and Palo Alto platforms, and I have experience applying Python and C# in security-related tasks. My interests lie in threat intelligence, situational awareness, and understanding how cyber threats operate in real-world environments. 
Beyond technical skills, I am a proactive and curious learner who actively participates in tech events and leadership activities. I am currently seeking opportunities to grow in the cybersecurity field and contribute to building secure and resilient systems.
