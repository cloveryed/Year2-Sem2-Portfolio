# 🦠 Malware Analysis – Static Analysis of Suspicious Executable

## Project Overview
This project focused on performing static analysis on a suspected malware sample to understand its structure, behavior, and potential threat indicators.

## Objective
To identify characteristics of a malicious executable using static analysis tools without executing the malware.

## Tools & Technologies
- PEview
- BinText
- Dependency Walker
- HxD Hex Editor
- VirusTotal

## What I Did
- Analyzed the PE file structure and headers
- Extracted readable strings to identify suspicious indicators
- Reviewed imported libraries and API calls
- Inspected hex data for embedded files or unusual patterns
- Correlated findings with online threat intelligence sources

## Skills Demonstrated
Static malware analysis • String analysis • PE structure review • IOC identification • Threat assessment

## Learning Outcomes
This project improved my ability to analyze suspicious files safely and identify indicators of compromise without executing potentially harmful code.
