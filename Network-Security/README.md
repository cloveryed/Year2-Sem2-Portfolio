# 🔐 Network Security – Firewall & VPN Implementation

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a secure enterprise-style network using a Palo Alto Next-Generation Firewall. The lab simulates two office locations connected via a secure site-to-site VPN.

## Objective
To design a segmented network architecture and enforce security policies to control traffic between departments and external networks.

## Tools & Technologies
- Palo Alto NGFW
- VMware (Lab Environment)
- Wireshark
- IPSec VPN
- VLAN Segmentation

## What I Did
- Designed a zone-based network architecture (DMZ, HR, IT, Sales)
- Configured firewall security policies for inter-zone traffic control
- Implemented a secure IPSec site-to-site VPN tunnel
- Created NAT rules for internal users to access the internet
- Configured SSL decryption policies with banking site exclusions
- Tested application filtering (e.g. blocking messaging features)

## Skills Demonstrated
Firewall configuration • VPN setup • Network segmentation • Security policy design • Traffic inspection

## Learning Outcomes
This project strengthened my understanding of enterprise firewall deployment, VPN configuration, and practical network segmentation strategies.

This project was completed in a controlled lab environment for academic purposes.
