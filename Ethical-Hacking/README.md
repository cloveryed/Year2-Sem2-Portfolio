# ⚔️ Ethical Hacking – Penetration Testing Simulation

## Project Overview
This project involved conducting a simulated penetration test on a vulnerable SME-style lab network. The assessment followed a structured attack lifecycle from reconnaissance to post-exploitation.

## Objective
To identify security vulnerabilities, exploit weaknesses, and evaluate the effectiveness of defensive controls in a controlled lab environment.

## Tools & Technologies
- Kali Linux
- Metasploit Framework
- Mimikatz
- Wireshark
- Proxychains

## What I Did
- Performed reconnaissance and service enumeration
- Exploited a vulnerable FTP service for initial access
- Conducted privilege escalation on compromised systems
- Performed lateral movement within the network
- Extracted credentials using post-exploitation tools
- Documented security gaps and recommended mitigations

## Skills Demonstrated
Vulnerability exploitation • Post-exploitation • Lateral movement • Credential analysis • Penetration testing methodology

## Learning Outcomes
This project gave me hands-on experience with real-world attack techniques and improved my understanding of how attackers move within a network after initial compromise.

All activities were performed in an isolated lab environment for academic training only.
