# 🌐 Web Application Penetration Testing – OWASP Top 10 Assessment

## Project Overview
This project involved assessing a web application for security vulnerabilities based on the OWASP Top 10 framework.

## Objective
To identify common web security issues and recommend remediation strategies to improve application security.

## Tools & Technologies
- Burp Suite
- OWASP ZAP
- SQLmap
- Browser Developer Tools

## What I Did
- Intercepted and analyzed HTTP requests and responses
- Tested for common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and weak session handling
- Reviewed security headers and Content Security Policy settings
- Assessed authentication and session management mechanisms
- Documented vulnerabilities and proposed fixes

## Skills Demonstrated
Web vulnerability testing • Proxy interception • Session analysis • Security misconfiguration detection • Risk assessment

## Learning Outcomes
This project strengthened my understanding of web application security risks and how attackers exploit insecure configurations and weak session management.

Testing was conducted in a permitted lab/testing environment for academic purposes only.
