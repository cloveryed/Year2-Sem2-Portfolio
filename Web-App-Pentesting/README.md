# Web Application Penetration Testing: OWASP Top 10 Assessment

**Course:** Web Application Penetration Testing, Year 2 Sem 3  
**Objective:** Conduct a comprehensive security assessment of a live e-commerce website (ON.com) following OWASP Top 10 2021 framework.  
**Tools Used:** Burp Suite, ZAP Proxy, SQLmap, Dirb, Nmap, WhatWeb, Postman  
**Key Skills:** OWASP Top 10 testing, Manual & automated penetration testing, Vulnerability assessment, Risk rating, Remediation planning  
**Methodology:** Reconnaissance → Scanning → Vulnerability Assessment → Exploitation → Reporting  

## Target Assessment!
- **Target:** ON.com (Swiss athletic wear e-commerce site)
- **Architecture:** Headless Shopify backend, Nuxt.js frontend
- **Scope:** User authentication, shopping cart, profile management, third-party integrations

## Key Findings by OWASP Category!

### 🔴 High Severity
- **A07: Identification & Authentication Failures** - Session cookies with 10-year expiration
- **A04: Insecure Design** - Weak Content Security Policy (CSP)
- **A05: Security Misconfiguration** - Potential admin pathway exposure
- **A08: Software & Data Integrity** - Missing SRI hashes in third-party scripts

### 🟡 Medium Severity
- **A03: Injection** - SQLi payloads partially accepted (sanitized to plaintext)

### 🟢 Low Severity/Passed
- **A01: Broken Access Control** - Effective access control implementation
- **A02: Cryptographic Failures** - Proper TLS/SSL configuration
- **A06: Outdated Components** - No vulnerable components detected

## Tools & Techniques!
- **Reconnaissance:** Dirb, WhatWeb, manual inspection
- **Vulnerability Scanning:** Burp Suite, ZAP automated scanning
- **Injection Testing:** SQLmap, manual payload testing
- **Session Analysis:** Cookie inspection, session management testing
- **Configuration Review:** Header analysis, CSP evaluation

## Risk Assessment!
Created vulnerability prioritization table with CVSS scoring and remediation timelines.

## Recommendations!
### Short-term (Immediate)
- Reduce session cookie lifetime from 10 years to 15-30 minutes
- Implement comprehensive CSP with strict directives
- Add SRI hashes to all third-party scripts
- Enforce server-side validation for all user inputs

### Long-term (Strategic)
- Implement MFA for sensitive operations
- Regular security audits and penetration testing
- Secure SDLC integration
- Continuous vulnerability scanning in CI/CD pipeline

## Learning Outcomes!
- Practical experience with OWASP Top 10 testing methodology
- Hands-on use of industry-standard penetration testing tools
- Real-world application security assessment skills
- Professional reporting and remediation planning
- Understanding of e-commerce security challenges
